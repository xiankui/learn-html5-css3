index.html is a simple tutorial of html5, a bone of html5,
learn from html-5-tutorial.com.

Essentially:
	html is how two computers speak to each other over the internet.
	web sites are what they say.

HTML is spoken by two computers:
	1. Client
		the client is used by the person surfing the net, such as the computer you are looking at right now.
	2. Server
		a server stores and distributes websites over the net. i have a server where i store the web site.

Web sites have two audiences:
	the first is human
	the other "spiders", "bot" or "web crawlers".

Title
	try to make it keyword heavy (repeat in the "decription"), and control less than 64 characters in length.

DIV	
	a generic container for flow content that by itself does not represent anything.

Header Footer Nav ect...
	these new elements help the bots see sites more like people.
